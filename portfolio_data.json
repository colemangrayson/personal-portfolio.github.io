      "description": "Under Dr. Ronald Falk at the UNC Kidney Center, I conducted bench research on immune-mediated kidney diseases, with a strong focus on T cell biology. My investigations into the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine's efficacy in immunosuppressed patients bridged the lab and the clinic, directly impacting patient care. This experience has transformed my commitment to medicine, desiring not only to be a practitioner of medicine as a physician but a contributor to medicine as a scientist.",
