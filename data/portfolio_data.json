My investigations into the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine’s efficacy in immunosuppressed patients bridged the lab and the clinic, poised to directly inform patient care. This experience has transformed my commitment to medicine, desiring not only to be a practitioner of medicine as a physician but a contributor to medicine as a scientist.",
